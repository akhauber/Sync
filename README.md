# Sync (iOS SwiftUI Prototype)

This repository contains a SwiftUI prototype implementation of **Sync**, a shift scheduling app designed around warm Apple-native soft glass UI patterns.

## Included
- Role-aware login (Worker / Manager)
- Worker tab flow: My Schedule, Marketplace, Availability, Profile
- Manager tab flow: Schedule, Manage, Notifications, Profile
- Insights layer and AI schedule generation CTA
- Reusable design-system primitives (`GlassCard`, `InsetWell`, `SoftButton`, `FilterChip`, `EmojiMoodScale`)

## Notes
- This is a v1 UI prototype intended to map product requirements to concrete screens and component structure.
- Network, persistence, push notifications, and backend locking are represented as placeholders for future integration.
